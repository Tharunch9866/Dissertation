3,"Strip 12 received K2 (180 kgK) 2001-2005 plus 450kgK in the autumn of 2000, and Mg2 (24kgMg) 2001-2005 plus 60 kg Mg in the autumn of 2000.  "
4,"N rate changed from N2 (96 kg N) to N4 (192 kgN) in 2001 in strips 10, 11, 13, 14 and 20. "
5,"Strip 17 and 18 N rate changed in 2001, and received full PKMg (previously half rate since 1968).  "
6,Strip 19 changed from residual castor bean meal to N1+1+1 KMg in 2001

10,"In 2010 date of application of Mg and K* not in Yield Book. Assumed K* same as P fertilizer and Mg same as K, as in previous years. "
11,In 2012 date of application of Mg and K not in Yield Book. Assumed same as P and K* as in previous years.
12,2013 forage maize yields are unreliable due to the accidental application of herbicide to the crop in June/July 2013. 
13,"Mg applied every third year (except strip 14) harvest years 1974-2000, ie autumn 1973, 1976, 1979â€¦1994, 1997. 2001 onwards applied annually. Details from White Books, 1993-2001. Assume same pattern for earlier years (1974-1992), as details could not be found in records.  "
