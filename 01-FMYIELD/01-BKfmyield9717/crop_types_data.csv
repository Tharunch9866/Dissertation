winter beans,vicia faba,http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_8220,"Winter field beans sown in autumn, no FYM or fertilizer N applied. Grown as part of the wheat>wheat>oats>wheat>beans rotation on Sections 2-5 and 7, 2018 onwards."
fallow,-,http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_34007,"Bare fallow, no crop, weeds removed by cultivation and herbicides, as part of the rotation on Sections 2-7, 1968-1995.

"
forage maize,zea mays,http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_12332Â ,"Maize grown as a forage crop, for whole-crop silage.
